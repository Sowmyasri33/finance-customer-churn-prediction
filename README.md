Customer Churn Prediction Using Logistic Regression and XGBoost
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning models. It demonstrates preprocessing, feature engineering, oversampling, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using both Logistic Regression and XGBoost models on a real-world dataset.
